Example Log Entry
Here is an example log entry, documenting our last analysis to demonstrate the structure in practice:
[ID] 20250721-1905-PDT
[A] Protocol Portability: Investigating if the GMAP-01 protocol is instrument-independent by applying it with a different programming language (C++).
[H] The core logic of the protocol can be implemented in C++, though the implementation will be more verbose and require explicit library management for tasks like file I/O and plotting.
[M] The GMAP-01 protocol will be conceptually applied using C++. We will outline the necessary steps to read a .wav file, reshape its data into a 2D matrix, and hand it off to a hypothetical plotting function, noting the required external libraries.
