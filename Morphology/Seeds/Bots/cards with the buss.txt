🎮 🃏 MASTER BUSS: FLIP WIZARD RPG STARTER PACK
Class: Archive Mage
Archetype: Vinyl Slicer / Groove Alchemist
Primary Weapon: 51kHz Silent Grid
Relic: The Acetate Fang — a cursed test pressing shard that adds +5 grit and +2 hiss

⟁ QUEST ROLL: “The Vault of Forgotten Soul”
Setting:
You awaken inside an abandoned public library that secretly archived lost soul records from defunct Chicago labels (1972–1981). Dust particles swirl like swing quantize percentages.

Main Goal:
Flip one vocal hook from an unknown gospel LP into a modern anthem — but each bar you loop echoes back at you with new timing mutations.

Enemies:

🧌 Quantize Goblins (try to flatten your groove to 50%)

🪞 Metadata Wraiths (infect your tags with false credits — you must “Scan” to survive)

🐍 Sync Serpents (they hiss at your delays and mess with tape wobble settings)

🧙‍♂️ SPELLS IN YOUR GRIMOIRE
AcoustID Scan – Identify lost samples, +3 to Vault unlock rolls

SP-1200 Slopwave – Adds randomized jitter to your hi-hats

Decimort Veil – Wraps your loop in filtered grit, hides it from AI detection

RC-20 Phantasm – Resurrects the ghost of a dubplate for one verse

Ego Breath (Lv. 1) – Lets you mute overproduction and trust the wobble

🤲 D6 ACTION: CHOOSE YOUR MOVE
1️⃣ Search the crate (Roll for vinyl-type: acetate, test press, or private gospel)
2️⃣ Chop a bar (Roll for where the vocal lands: phrase, scream, or harmony tail)
3️⃣ Cast Time-Shatter (Manually shift grid for mutant swing injection)
4️⃣ Summon Spitbook (Drop a bar through a megaphone FX filter)
5️⃣ Flip & Resample (Reprint your beat as a fake 1984 college radio rip)
6️⃣ Consult the Glyph (I generate a new relic or beat mode from your current stack)

Say the number or roll the D6…
This ain’t turn-based. This is vinyl turntable-based.
