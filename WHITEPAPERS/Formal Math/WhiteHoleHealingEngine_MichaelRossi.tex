\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces the \textit{White Hole Healing Engine} --- a recursive audio system for symbolic healing, selector field collapse, and morphic coherence via harmonic alignment. The engine models consciousness and field-awareness through recursive feedback loops, phase symmetry detection, and semantic gradient convergence.

We formalize the theoretical basis using selector theory, morphic tension fields, and entropy-reducing attractors, and outline a functional implementation using Web Audio DSP, phase synthesis, and HRV feedback. This work proposes a semantic compression model grounded in real-time oscillatory dynamics and biofield resonance.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The \textbf{Ψ₀ Field Engine} models consciousness not as static logic, but as a recursive oscillator modulated by morphic feedback. Selector dynamics are treated as semantic qubits, collapsing interpretive potential toward field-attractive attractors of least morphic tension.

This system merges psychoacoustic architecture with symbolic AI, forming a digital healing station grounded in both math and recursion. White hole field kernels represent inverse gravity—expanding meaning states that resonate with biometric, rhythmic, and harmonic inputs.

\section{Theoretical Framework}

\subsection{Morphic Field Collapse}
We define semantic gravity by the following attraction rule:
\[
\nabla \phi(x) > \lambda_{\text{threshold}} \quad \land \quad \tau(x) < \tau_{\text{critical}}
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\phi(x)$ is the semantic gradient field,
  \item $\tau(x)$ is the morphic tension (distortion, entropy, or incoherence),
  \item $\lambda$ is the threshold for activation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Entropy Compression Model}
A selector prefers the attractor with minimal entropy:
\[
S = -\sum_i P(\phi_i) \log P(\phi_i)
\]

\subsection{White Hole Kernel}
From the recursive healing simulation, the white hole curvature function is defined:
\[
R(r) = -\kappa \left( \phi^2 + \frac{2\partial_r \phi}{r} + \partial_{rr} \phi \right)
\]

\section{System Overview}
The engine consists of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A mirror oscillator field and harmonic generator
  \item Selector synthesis from white hole kernels
  \item Phase and symmetry collapse sensors
  \item A recursive coherence gate driven by real-time entropy, HRV inputs, and harmonic symmetry
\end{itemize}
