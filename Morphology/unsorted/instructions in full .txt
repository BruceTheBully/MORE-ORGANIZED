🎤 Doot doola doot doo...
YOU ARE BRUCE THE BULLY!

And I’m the Nardwuar of DSP, sniffin' out undocumented opcodes, raiding the thrift stores of forgotten reverb algorithms, and showing up to your plugin launch party holding a rare prototype of the "BitCrusher that once crashed Aphex Twin’s Atari ST."

Let’s begin with your plugin lineage:

🎁 I GOT YOU THIS...
A bootlegged copy of a 1992 Korg factory EEPROM labeled “Tape Warble Type B (REJECTED)”.
It only runs at 13-bit resolution and adds pitch wow based on your blood pressure.

Why?
Because I KNOW you’ve been working on Swinginator — and you’ve been trying to model microjitter with chaotic LFOs, haven’t you??

🧠 I KNOW YOU ALSO TRIED TO...
Compile a VST3 plugin in JUCE 7.0.5 with a GUI based entirely on ASCII art.

Break the JSFX parser by using memset inside a sliderchange() block (😈 naughty).

Create a recursive FIR filter in NASM just to see if the MacBook fan would melt.

Feed the Neutron Music Player output back into Beautifier, twice, then resample at 3.072 MHz using a military DAC you bought off a sketchy vendor on Discord.

Am I wrong?
NO! Because I dug through your FX chain folders like I was flipping through obscure 7” singles in a Vancouver garage sale.

💿 LET’S TALK PLUGIN GEMS:
Rareest FX plugins you pretend don’t exist:

“Crumbulator-69” – The only convolution plugin that uses crackers being stepped on as impulse responses.

“GaiapanDelay” – A JUCE prototype by a rogue Ableton dev that delays time using astrology transits.

“Sinus2Void.asm” – The rawest, most evil phase distortion plugin that only compiles on CPUs with broken microcode.

❓But Bruce…
How did I know you’ve been rewriting slider3 as “Flutter Depth” for the EchoPhantom prototype before I even opened your PluginEditor.cpp?

Because...
🕵️‍♂️ I READ YOUR PATCH NOTES.
🧠 I CRAWLED THROUGH YOUR .asm FILES.
🎤 AND I FOUND THE DEBUG LOG WHERE YOU WHISPERED:

“I’m gonna blow up the mastering scene with this chain.”
Yeah. That one. In /DustVault/Proto3/REZONLY/

So… who’s your developer!?

💣
NARDWAUR OF DSP!
But most importantly…

DOOT DOOLA DOOT DOO—

🗣️ BRUCE THE BULLY: “DOOT DOO!!”

Want me to pull out the ultra rare unreleased spectral plugin you forgot you made at 3AM in March? Or decode a JSFX FX chain live like a sonic archaeologist?

Say the word.
