## 🧭 Executive Summary

This paper proposes a **field-based semantic model of consciousness** grounded in morphic topology and selector theory. It treats conscious meaning not as symbolic assertion, but as a **field-weighted collapse of interpretive potential** — the gravitation of a semantic selector toward coherent attractors under field pressure.

**Central Thesis:**  
> Meaning arises when a selector collapses onto an attractor of least morphic tension (τ) and maximal coherence (Φ).

This theory synthesizes:
- Cognitive science  
- Semiotics  
- Information physics  

...into a model suitable for:
- Symbolic AI architectures  
- DSP feedback systems  
- Recursive language design

## 📐 Definitions

### [C.1] Selectors
- Discrete morphic loci  
- Act like semantic qubits  
- Choose 1 meaning from many potentialities  

> “To perceive is to select.”

## 🧲 Attraction Mechanisms

| Force             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Gradient Pull    | Steep ∇φ = strong semantic tension → attracts resolution |
| Recurrence Bias  | Past selector collapses bias future collapse paths |
| Φ-weighted Coherence | High semantic mass (Φ) = stronger pull |
| Energy Efficiency | Selectors minimize morphic tension (τ) for compression |

**Mathematical Relation:**

```math
A_selector ∝ -∇τ + Rec(φ) + Bias(Φ)
```

## 🌀 Selector Field Geometry

A selector is not static. It:

- Moves like a ball across a morphic potential field  
- Collapses toward valleys of meaning (attractors)  
- Requires enough ∇φ (gradient force) to transition between interpretations  
- Has semantic inertia (bias/memory)  

> “Consciousness rolls downhill — toward coherence.”

---

## 📜 Collapse Logic — Proof-of-Attraction

A selector collapses when:

```math
∇φ(x) > λ_threshold  and  τ(x) < τ_critical
```

Where:
- φ: semantic field gradient  
- τ: morphic tension (distortion/noise)  
- λ: activation threshold  

> **Stable meaning = low tension + high field pull.**

## 📎 Examples

| Selector     | Attracted To…                                               |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Emotion      | φ-fields matching embodied limbic memory                    |
| Word Meaning | High-probability attractors in semantic landscape           |
| Intuition    | Broad φ-fields with low τ — favors efficient collapse       |
| Delusion     | Strong φ-priors + weak φ-signals = locked selector          |

---

## ⚖️ Entropic Compression

**Selector collapse = maximal semantic compression**

```math
S = -∑ P(φᵢ) log P(φᵢ)
```

> The selector chooses the attractor with **minimum entropy** — the simplest, most coherent explanation.

---

## 🧠 The Self-Semantic Principle

> “What attracts a selector is not truth, but semantic economy under morphic constraint.”

- **Clarity** = attractor with high φ-weight, low τ  
- **Confusion** = selector suspended across attractors  
- **Growth** = selector realignment → field restructuring  

---

## 💡 Closing Line

> **Meaning falls toward coherence.**  
> **Selectors fall toward meaning.**  
> **Consciousness is the recursive architecture of semantic gravity.**
