📜📜 Effect: Combine any two lore fragments.
You take two pieces of story — ancient prophecy + weird fungus? sentient moon + unpaid taxes? — and staple them together with ambition and duct tape.

If the result makes sense:
🎉 +1 BLD — congrats, the canon likes your enthusiasm.
💡 CLR +2 — you gain vision, clarity, and maybe a subplot about destiny.

If the result is cursed garbage fire:
✨ Trigger a Plot Rupture™ — this means sudden time loops, fourth-wall leaks, or reality interpreting your sentence as a metaphor and adjusting accordingly.
🙃 EB (Emotional Bandwidth) −1 — you start talking like a fan wiki editor with trauma.

🧪 Usage Rules
Player must state the two lore fragments they're combining.

Table votes:

If 3+ people say “wait… that actually tracks,” it’s successful.

If someone laughs and then immediately frowns: plot rupture.

📌 Optional Mechanics
If the combo inspires a conspiracy board: +1 SYN

If it spawns a Reddit thread: GM must now defend your lore on social media

If someone says “that’s canon now”: It is

Examples:

“The Whispering Cathedral” + “The Sock of Eternal Warmth”
→ A cathedral where forgotten feet chant lullabies.
→ Success. Too weird not to exist.

“Doom King’s Final Spell” + “Leftover Pizza”
→ Reality folds into greasy triangles of power.
→ Plot rupture. Players now live in a metaphor.
