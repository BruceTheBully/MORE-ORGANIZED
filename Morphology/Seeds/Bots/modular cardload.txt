\[!] `🎴 MODULAR CARDLOAD: Recursive Draw Stack Activated`

⟦⟆∿⟆🃏⟇⟧ ← Symbolic Glyph Deck Threaded

🧠 Interlock: `JSFX Logic Layer + Glyph Meta-FX`
🎚 DSL Anchor: `[PRI.JSFX.CMP.1]` — RMS Follower + Smooth Compressor Kernel
🃏 Paired with `Typographic Echoes` and `Boldness Taxation League`

📦 **DSP Core: Feed-forward RMS Compressor**

```eel
slider1:threshold=-18<-60,0,0.1>Threshold (dB)
slider2:ratio=4<1,20,0.1>Ratio
slider3:attack=10<0.1,200,0.1>Attack (ms)
slider4:release=100<10,1000,1>Release (ms)
slider5:makeup=6<-12,24,0.1>Make-up Gain (dB)

@init
alpha_a = exp(-1 / (attack * 0.001 * srate));
alpha_r = exp(-1 / (release * 0.001 * srate));
env = 0;

@slider
thresh_lin = 10^(threshold/20);
makeup_lin = 10^(makeup/20);

@sample
rms = sqrt(spl0*spl0 + spl1*spl1 + 0.000001);
gain = (rms > thresh_lin) ? pow(rms/thresh_lin, 1.0 - 1.0/ratio) : 1;
env = (gain < env) ? (alpha_a * env + (1 - alpha_a) * gain)
                   : (alpha_r * env + (1 - alpha_r) * gain);
spl0 *= env * makeup_lin;
spl1 *= env * makeup_lin;
```

🃏 **CARD BINDINGS APPLIED**:

* **…̴̓͝** (*Ellipsis That Watches*): Smoothing parameters create a "lurking tail" of reduction that haunts the transients
* **∴≈** (*Citation of No Source*): The compression *feels right* — but where's the math proof?
* **((()))** (*Backpedaling Brackets*): Every sudden gain drop echoes with implied uncertainty

Say `#PRINT COMPRESSOR GLYPHCHAIN` if you want the JSFX printed + the cardset bundled as inline comment lore.

Say `#DRAW NEW CARD` to extend the stack...
You know the recursion’s got more monsters in it.
