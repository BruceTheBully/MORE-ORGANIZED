zing the Architecture

I'm now grappling with the underlying architecture for this live coding HTML application. The user wants a VS Code-like environment within a single HTML file, which demands careful consideration.  I'm exploring options like CodeMirror or Monaco Editor to provide the editing experience, but I need to balance this with the requirement for ephemeral execution and a clean slate. I'm also planning how to integrate the user's desired block formatting and the "mirroring structure" approach for logic interpretation.

Defining the Execution Context

I'm now fully immersed in the core technical problem: building a JavaScript interpreter that understands the user's custom syntax and effectively mirrors the structure of their code. I'm prioritizing the "no storing" aspect, focusing on ephemeral execution with the recall of past inputs. I'm exploring strategies for "mirroring structure" to avoid actual code execution while still conveying the logic's intended impact. The goal is to make the interpreted state obvious to the user.

Interpreting the Core Needs

I'm now focusing on the interpreter's design. The user desires a "notepad" feel but with VS Code-like editing and real-time logic interpretation, using their custom block format. This memory-and-no-storing constraint is a key challenge. I'll focus on demonstrating the impact of the user-written logic, not on execution. The block format is key to demonstrating the logic they define.

I'm focusing on how I can add a code editor that will not increase the file size too much, so that it will feel like VS Code, while still maintaining the requested blank memory.

Adding Line Number Support

I'm currently working to add the "VS Code" editor spirit to the application. I've successfully added line numbers to the textarea by dynamically generating a counter. This addition should help the user write their custom logic in a more structured format, which is important for the mirroring of the STRUCTURR structure.

Implementing the Editor Spirit

I'm currently incorporating the "VS Code" editor spirit, focusing on adding a "textarea" and styling line numbers dynamically. I've designed a Javascript counter function to add line numbers alongside the "textarea", making writing logic more structured. This addition will help mirror the STRUCTURR structure, following the user's intent.

Expanding the Interpreter Core

I'm making progress on the core interpreter. I've designed the script blocks to trigger my own responses in the HTML file, the mirroring structure is coming to life. I have also added in the "50 Shades of Collapse" data to help the interpretations and definitions.

\n\nRefining the Interaction

I've implemented the textarea and a basic "Run" button for interactivity. I'm focusing on parsing the input, recognizing the user's custom syntax (notes, equations, script blocks), and generating appropriate responses in the output area. The plan is to create structured JavaScript code for these types of user input.

Expanding the Interpreter Core

I'm expanding the interpreter. The "script block" interpretation is underway; I'm generating a JavaScript-like interpretLogic() function. It's parsing the notes, equations, and code blocks, and outputting their effects within the STRUCTURR world. Memory management is next.

Adding Syntax Interpretation

I've successfully integrated the "Run" button and established an initial parsing structure. The application now recognizes and interprets user-defined syntax (notes, equations, script blocks), generating structured JavaScript for each input type. This interpretation sets the foundation for "mirroring structure."

Adjusting for Memory Recall

I've been working on the memory functionality to address the user's desire for remembering prior commands. The user wants the application to be blank at first but also remember past entries and current states. I'm focusing on crafting a history function that provides this recall without intruding upon the clean, blank feeling of the workspace. This should be combined with the "Run" button functionality.

\n\nEnhancing the "Run" Function

I am building a "Clear" function and a "History" as well. I'm focusing on user-defined custom syntax within STRUCTURR, using the "50 Shades of Collapse."

Enhancing the "VS Code"

I've been working on integrating a styled editor, making the input area look more like a "VS Code" environment. I've added a basic memory function by implementing a local storage system. Now, the user can write in a familiar coding experience with line numbers and a dynamic "REPL".

Launching the Interactive Editor

I'm now fully immersed in developing the interactive HTML editor with the "VS Code" spirit. I'm focusing on user-defined custom syntax,  the addition of memory, and how I can interpret the data within the STRUCTURR world. The integration of  50 Shades of Collapse is ready, with the addition of a history function.

Refining the Editor's Spirit

I'm now integrating the "VS Code" editor spirit to the solution. I've designed a "Run" button to give it a REPL-like interaction. The focus is on the custom glyph syntax and the interpretations within STRUCTURR. I am building a history and clear function.

\n\nInterpreting User Syntax

I'm now deep in interpreting user-defined syntax and script blocks. I have a custom library and interpret user input within the STRUCTURR context. I'm focusing on "Run" functionality and adding memory. I am including "50 Shades of Collapse" information.
