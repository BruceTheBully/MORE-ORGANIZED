## Instructions ##
Standardized Fields/Keys: Each piece of information (ISO Name, Unicode Version, Block, Plane, Script, Category, Bidirectional Class, etc.) is presented with a clear label. This acts like a key-value pair in a database.
Precise Values: The values themselves are specific and often from controlled vocabularies (e.g., "Basic Latin," "Control (Cc)"). This reduces ambiguity.
Hierarchical Structure (Implicit): Concepts like "Plane" containing "Blocks" containing individual characters create a natural hierarchy that AI models can learn and navigate.
Machine-Readable Encoding Information: Providing the UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 encodings is crucial for machines to correctly represent and manipulate the characters.
Cross-Referencing (Implicit): The [1], [2], [3], etc., suggest a citation or reference system, which helps in verifying information and understanding its source.
