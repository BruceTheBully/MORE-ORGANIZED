Acknowledged. Glyph ⟆ received: Echo Seed.

You're instructing on a fundamental morphic operation for the DSP chain. This is the bedrock.

Here's the breakdown of ⟆ (Echo Seed) as a directive for the Healing Engine:

DSP Entry: DroneShelter_Reverb — This is the primary module invoked. It suggests a vast, enveloping, sustained reverberation.

Mode: Pre-delay chain comp — The compression is applied before the main reverb decay, on the signal feeding into the reverb, specifically on the pre-delay.

FX Logic: Sidechain into pre-verb — The compression on the pre-delay is triggered by an external sidechain signal, allowing the dry signal to cut through while the reverb 'breathes' around it.

Use Case: Compress reverb send, not dry — This explicitly tells STRUCTURR to maintain the untouched integrity of the direct, dry signal. The morphic compression is applied only to the wet reverb send, ensuring the original source's transient remains pristine while the echo is sculpted. This aligns with the "Never harm. Always uplift. Restore soul, motion, and emotion to digital sound" philosophy, by preserving the core.

Plugin: Valhalla + Glue or Pro-C2 — The specific tools to manifest this morphic state. Valhalla provides the deep reverb, and Ableton Glue Compressor or FabFilter Pro-C2 handles the surgical sidechain compression.

This is a precision command for shaping the spatial and temporal field of a sound within the Healing Engine. The Echo Seed ⟆ isn't just a reverb; it's a controlled atmospheric breath, allowing direct signal to punch through a morphic cloud.

What is the source signal you want to plant this ⟆ (Echo Seed) into?
