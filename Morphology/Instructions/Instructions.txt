 ## Instructions ##

* **ProjectMeta.**: Describes the plugin's metadata (e.g., name, version, formats).
* **Files.csv**: Lists the file paths and roles (headers, source files, etc.).
* **Parameters.csv**: Defines parameters (such as ranges and defaults).
* **DSP\_Modules.csv**: Contains information on DSP modules, their functions, and logic.
* **UI\_Components.csv**: Specifies UI components and their associations.
* **Patterns.csv**: Describes templates and patterns for code generation.
* **Connections.csv**: Defines how different components are connected (parameters, DSP modules, UI components).

By parsing these files, we can dynamically generate the corresponding JUCE C++ classes, methods, and logic in real-time as instructed by the text file.

### A possible flow could be:

1. **Read the .csv files**: Extract the rows and data for each section.
2. **Process the instructions**: Use the instruction file to understand how to format, connect, or manipulate the data from the csvs.
3. **Generate the JUCE code**: Based on the parsed .csv data, generate corresponding JUCE code in real-time.
4. **Output the generated files**: The code could be written to appropriate `.cpp`/`.h` files for the JUCE plugin.

### Benefits:

* **Flexibility**: You can define multiple plugins with their own structures by modifying just the csv files.
* **Automation**: The process of creating and connecting modules/components in JUCE becomes automated, which can save time when building a new plugin or UI setup.
* **Scalability**: Adding new plugins, parameters, DSP modules, or UI components can be done by simply adding rows in the respective csv files.

### Next Step:

To make this happen, here's how we can structure the `.txt` instruction file:

1. **Section Descriptions**:

   * For example, `ProjectMeta.csv` would have a section that describes the general template for a pluginâ€™s metadata. We can define the fields (`pluginName`, `version`, etc.) and specify how to handle each one.

2. **Mapping Logic**:

   * Define what the data in each file corresponds to in terms of JUCE classes and methods.
   * For instance, `Parameters.csv` might be mapped to `AudioProcessorParameter` objects in JUCE, and `DSP_Modules.csv` could map to `AudioProcessor` subclasses.

3. **Example Instructions**:

   ```txt
   [ProjectMeta]
   - pluginName -> JUCE Plugin Name
   - version -> Version
   - formats -> VST3, AU, AAX
   ```

4. **Code Templates**:

   * Provide templates for how the generated code should look. For example, a template for the DSP module or parameter class might look like this:

   ```txt
   [DSP_Module]
   - moduleID: M1
   - name: Gain
   - function: applyGain
   - dependencies: None
   - logic: output = input * gain;
   ```

5. **File Generation**:

   * At the end, generate files (such as `.cpp`, `.h`, etc.) from these templates based on the parsed data.

Let me know if you want to give this a try, and I can help draft a sample instruction file or assist in setting up the parsing logic!
