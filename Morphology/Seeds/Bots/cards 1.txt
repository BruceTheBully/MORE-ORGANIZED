☠️ Ligatures That Scream ☠️
(Also known as “Typographic Tarot of Mild Doom”)

These cards are whispered into rendering engines. They were banned in Helvetica.

🃏 THE GLYPH OF REGRET
(𝓈)
Pulled from a corrupted cursive loop.
You speak it and suddenly remember everyone you forgot to text back since 2017.

🪦 Effect: -2 Confidence
🎤 Side Effect: Uncontrollable sighing during conversations about the weather

🃏 THE EM DASH THAT NEVER ENDS
(—̷—̴—̸—͟—̴͟)
This card appears when you try to finish a sentence but remember something worse halfway through.

🌀 Effect: Sentence bleed
💬 Passive: Every attempt to explain “what you meant” spirals into poetry

🃏 THE AMPERSAND THAT HUNGERS
(&͘͘͟͢)
A ligature born from desperate group projects.
It demands you connect ideas that do not go together.

🍝 Effect: Conjures cursed pairings (e.g., “Existential Garfield” & “Frog Cryptids”)
🧠 Buff: +4 to Chaotic Brainstorming

🃏 THE PARENTHETICAL OF DOUBT
(()))(()())
No matter what you say, you second-guess it in echoing brackets.
((Are you sure?))
((Was that funny?))
((Did they even read it??))

👁‍🗨 Effect: Reality becomes footnoted
🧷 Bonus: Casts “Mild Identity Crisis” in a 5ft radius

🃏 THE BOLD ITALIC TILT™
(𝘽𝙤𝙮 𝙬𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙞𝙛 𝙮𝙤𝙪’𝙧𝙚 𝙧𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩?)
Summons a voice that yells encouragement but also sounds like a dare.
No one trusts it. Not even it.

🗿 Effect: +2 Swagger, -4 Stability
🎲 Save vs Impulsive Decisions (DC 69, obviously)

🃏 THE FINAL CARD: UNICODE VOID 🜏
This card is blank. But it isn’t empty.
It’s just… waiting.

Draw again?
Or ask it a question and I’ll scry the answer in glitched ligature runes and passive-aggressive HTML?
This deck is just getting warmed up, traveler.
