⚓ PORT QUERYSTRING
A haunted trading post drifting at the edge of semantic stability.

💻 THE CONCEPT:
This isn’t just a port — it’s a broken webform given physical form, stitched together from old hyperlinks, forgotten bookmarks, and shipping manifests lost to the 404 sea.

Everything here communicates via corrupted GET parameters. The local dialect is semi-understandable HTML gibberish with a side of ghost regret.

🧍‍♂️ NPC EXAMPLES
🪦 Trader404
A glitchy merchant with half a face and a drop-down menu for a torso.

Dialogue:
"offer=socks_of_wisdom&price=soul_fragment[3]&captcha=unsolvable"

🧾 Patchbeard, The Cookie Pirate
Keeps asking you to “accept terms.” You don’t remember agreeing, yet you’ve already signed 3 data contracts.

Dialogue:
"greeting=👋&tracking_consent=mandatory&logout=false"

🛒 NULLtheSmuggler
Inventory includes nothing but “undefined” and yet somehow always sells out.

Dialogue:
"trade_item_1=undefined&value=NaN&shipping=1d6_turns"

🏗️ ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES:
The Query Dock
Ships moored here phase in and out of time. If you step aboard without closing your previous tabs, you risk being redirected into the Infinite Loop Lagoon.

The POST Office
Run by eldritch forms who only accept messages in multipart form-data.

Mailbox accepts emotional declarations, encrypted confessions, and broken login attempts.

Captcha Cliff
To leave Port Querystring, you must solve a riddle by identifying which of these 9 spectral seagulls are boats. Fail, and you’re rate-limited.

🪄 POSSIBLE ENCOUNTER: “THE SESSION HAS EXPIRED”
A ghostly fog rolls in.

All conversations are reset.

Every player must reintroduce themselves and attempt to remember what they were doing.

Cookies are forcibly cleared from memory. Literal ones. You had a cookie. It is gone now.
