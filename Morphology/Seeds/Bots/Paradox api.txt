Exactly! You're thinking along the right lines. Creating your own symbolic or visual language essentially involves defining a **lexicon and a set of rules**—an API—then mapping those to computational constructs like loops, conditionals, and functions. Here's a step-by-step outline of how you might approach this:

---

### 1. **Design the Lexicon & Symbols**

- **Identify key constructs:** e.g., loops, conditionals, functions, variables, etc.
- **Assign symbols or glyphs:** e.g., a specific glyph or glyph sequence represents a loop, another for a conditional, etc.
- **Decide on syntax rules:** how do symbols combine? Are they sequential? Nested? Parallel?

*Example:*  
- `⟳` (a special glyph) = loop  
- `⟹` = function call  
- `⊥` = false / end / paradox

---

### 2. **Map to Computational Constructs**

- **Create an interpreter or compiler** that reads these symbols and translates them into actual code in a real language or directly executes them.
- **Define an API or semantics**: what does each symbol mean? How do they interact?

*Example:*  
- When the interpreter sees `⟳`, it initiates a loop in Python or C++.
- When it sees `⟹`, it calls a function or executes a block.

---

### 3. **Implement a Runtime or Interpreter**

- Write an engine (in Python, C++, or any language) that:
  - Parses the glyph sequences.
  - Recognizes patterns or sequences.
  - Executes corresponding functions or logic.

*Example:*  
```python
def interpret(code):
    # Parse the code glyphs
    # Map glyphs to functions
    # Handle recursion, loops, etc.
```

---

### 4. **Incorporate Paradoxes & Loops**

- Since you're imagining "paradox" or "recursion," your interpreter can handle non-standard constructs:
  - Infinite loops (if desired)
  - Self-referential functions
  - Paradoxical states (e.g., a function that calls itself in a way that defies termination)

*Example:*  
Create a glyph that, when interpreted, causes the engine to re-enter a state or produce an infinite/recursive process that *defies* traditional logic.

---

### 5. **Creative Variations & Extensions**

- **Different "dialects":** create different sets of symbols with their own semantics.
- **Visual code:** arrange glyphs spatially for nested or parallel logic.
- **Paradoxical constructs:** design symbols that, when interpreted, create recursive or paradoxical behaviors.

---

### 6. **Make It 'Alive' & Playable**

- Build a visual editor or a parser that allows you to craft these glyph sequences.
- Run them through your interpreter.
- Watch the "paradox" or "loop" unfold in real time.

---

### Summary

- **Map symbols to functions or constructs** just like in traditional programming languages.
- **Design a parser or interpreter** that recognizes your custom syntax.
- **Implement core constructs**: loops, conditionals, recursion, and paradoxes.
- **Play with logic and recursion**—since you’re working in a symbolic universe, you can experiment with behaviors that break or bend normal logic.
